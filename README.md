# AWS VPC

## Instructions on how to set up infrastructure behind a secure virtual private cloud on Amazon web services.

I'm going to start with an outline based on my most recent notes. Once I've documented the overall process, I'll take some time and go back and flesh it out with more detail.

### Ultimately, we're going to set up these items:
- Virtual Private Cloud to secure all of the system's infrastructure.
- Security Group to control access to all the instances on the vpc.
- Network ACL (Access Control List)
- Private Subnets to allow the instances to communicate behind the vpc.
- Public Subnets 
- Route Tables
- Elastic IP
- NAT (Network Access Translation) Gateway 
- IGW (Internet Gateway)
- Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)
-
